# Goodbye, vim.

After many, many years of configuration, reading, learning, and workflow
management, I've decided to leave vim. Emacs and Intellij hold my heart now.
Vim, you've taught me much, and I will certainly use the lessons I've gained
from here. Goodbye.

# dotfiles

The rest of this repo is dedicated to my old Vim configuration, and my config
files for xmod, regolith, zsh, and any other tools I use. Thank you.
